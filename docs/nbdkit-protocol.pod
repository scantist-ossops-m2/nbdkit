=head1 NAME

nbdkit - which parts of the NBD protocol nbdkit supports

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit [-n|--newstyle] [-o|--oldstyle] [-e|--exportname EXPORTNAME]
        [...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This page documents the level of support in nbdkit for various parts
of the NBD protocol.

=head1 NEW STYLE VS OLD STYLE PROTOCOL

The NBD protocol comes in two incompatible forms that we call
"oldstyle" and "newstyle".  Unfortunately which protocol you should
use depends on the client and cannot be known in advance, nor can it
be negotiated from the server side.

nbdkit defaults to the newstyle protocol since nbdkit E<ge> 1.3.  The
newstyle protocol is better in every respect than the oldstyle
protocol and you should prefer it if possible.

Use the I<-e> or I<--exportname> flag to set the optional exportname
for the newstyle protocol.

Use the I<-o> or I<--oldstyle> flag to force the oldstyle protocol.

=head2 Common clients and the protocol they require

 Client                          Protocol
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 qemu <= 2.5 without exportname  oldstyle
 qemu <= 2.5 with exportname     newstyle
 qemu >= 2.6                     client can talk either protocol
 nbd-client < 3.10               client can talk either protocol
 nbd-client >= 3.10              newstyle
 any TLS (encrypted) client      newstyle
 nbdkit nbd plugin               client can talk either protocol

=head2 Errors seen if using the wrong protocol

If you use qemu E<le> 2.5 without the exportname field against a
newstyle server, it will give the error:

 Server requires an export name

If you use qemu E<le> 2.5 with the exportname field against an
oldstyle server, it will give the error:

 Server does not support export names

If you use the oldstyle protocol with nbd-client E<ge> 3.10, it will
give the error:

 Error: It looks like you're trying to connect to an oldstyle server.

=head2 NBD protocol and port number

Port 10809/tcp is reserved by IANA for the NBD protocol, but you can
use nbdkit on any port or on Unix domain sockets.

The NBD protocol specification claims that you should always use
newstyle when using port 10809, and use oldstyle on all other ports,
but this claim is not based on the reality of what NBD servers do, and
nbdkit does not require or encourage this.

=head1 NBD PROTOCOL FEATURES SUPPORTED BY NBDKIT

=over 4

=item newstyle protocol

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.1.12, and the default in nbdkit E<ge> 1.3.

=item export names

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.1.12.

nbdkit can advertise an export name, but ignores any export name sent
by the client.  nbdkit does I<not> support serving different data on
different export names.

=item C<NBD_FLAG_NO_ZEROES>

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.1.13.

This protocol optimization avoids sending a useless block of zero
bytes during protocol negotiation.

=item C<NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES>

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.1.13.

=item TLS with X.509 certificates

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.1.15.

=item TLS with Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.4.0.

=item C<NBD_OPT_GO>

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.5.3.

This protocol enhancement allows the server to return errors when
negotiating the export name.

=item C<NBD_OPT_INFO>

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.9.3.

This protocol enhancement allows a client to inspect details about
the export without actually connecting.

=item C<NBD_FLAG_CAN_MULTI_CONN>

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.9.9.

=item Structured Replies

Supported in nbdkit E<ge> 1.11.8.

However we donâ€™t expose the capability to send structured replies to
plugins yet, nor do we send human-readable error messages using this
facility.

=item Block Status

I<Not supported>.

=item Resize Extension

I<Not supported>.
